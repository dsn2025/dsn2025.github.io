                <b>Abstract:</b>   
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the defining technology of this century, poised to transform global power dynamics in unprecedented ways. Unlike nuclear weapons, primarily associated with strategic deterrence, AI will serve as both the main pillar of national digital sovereignty and an integral part of everyday life, influencing economic trends and social interactions. Its opaque decision-making processes yield unpredictable errors, creating security, safety, and governance challenges that far exceed those posed by any other technology. In this talk, we explore the interconnected issues of global power, AI technology sourcing, errors, ethical considerations, and regulatory shifts. We examine approaches employed by the USA, EU, and China as they attempt to navigate this paradox.

              <b>Abstract:</b>   
              Machine learning solutions are revolutionizing AI, but their instability against adversarial examples – small perturbations to inputs that can drastically change the output – raises concerns about the readiness of this technology for widespread deployment. Formal verification, and particularly probabilistic verification, have become indispensable components of rigorous engineering methodologies to ensure system safety and dependability. Using illustrative examples, this lecture will discuss the role that formal verification technology can play in motion planning by providing provable guarantees on safety and optimality of neural network policies.

              <b>Abstract:</b>   
              Modern systems—ranging from mobile robots and aerial drones to connected and autonomous vehicles—seamlessly span across the compute continuum, from microcontrollers to large-scale data centers. Yet, much of today’s technology stack remains fragmented, relying on legacy solutions designed for a vastly different era. The result? Inefficient, architecturally disjointed, and energy-draining systems—the closest approximation to what one might call a Digital Frankenstein.
This challenge is exacerbated by the proliferation of battery-powered devices, where energy efficiency is paramount. Inefficient communication protocols and rigid storage policies force unnecessary data transfers, consuming both network resources and precious battery life. Addressing these inefficiencies requires a fundamental shift in how we approach communication, computation, and storage—not just incremental patches on outdated paradigms.
In this keynote, we will trace the evolution of distributed computing middleware, exploring the key technological drivers that have shaped it over the years. We will then introduce Zenoh, a next-generation distributed computing framework that unifies communication, computation, and storage across the entire compute continuum, from microcontrollers to the cloud. We will examine why Zenoh is emerging as the de facto protocol for next-generation robotics, intelligent transportation systems, and advanced IoT/Edge applications. Finally, we will look ahead to the future of distributed computing, discussing upcoming trends and how they will shape the next wave of intelligent, energy-efficient systems.
