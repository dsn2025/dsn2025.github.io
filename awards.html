    <h2 id="bpa"><b>DSN 2025 Best Paper Award</b></h2>
    <p>DSN attributes a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted scientific
    papers. The selection of the candidate papers for the award is carried out
    first by the Program Committee that picks up to six of the accepted papers;
    then, the Steering Committee chooses among these six papers the three
    candidate papers to be presented in a special session at the conference;
    finally, the audience at the conference votes for the paper that should
    receive the award.</p>

    <p>The Test-of-Time Award was instituted to recognize two papers published 10 years ago in DSN, in the regular paper, the practical experience report or the tool demonstration category. DSN has several areas under its umbrella and with two awards there are conditions to recognize more than one area.</p>
 
    <p>Nominations can be made by any person who is familiar with the paper. Nominations must be submitted by email to the DSN Steering Committee Chair
    (<a href="SC_chair@dsn.org">SC_chair@dsn.org</a>) and are due on <b><u>December 20, 2024</u></b>.  Make sure the words Test-of-Time Award are in the subject line. The winning work will be announced by <b><u>April, 2025</u></b>.</p>
     
    <p>The supporting material for the nomination should include:
      <ul>

    <h2 id="artifact"><b>DSN 2025 Distinguished Artifact Award</b></h2>

    <p>DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their tools and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. New this year, DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools.</p>

    <p>All artifacts submitted will compete for a “<b>Distinguished Artifact Award</b>” that is sponsored by TBD, to be decided by the committee. This will be awarded to the artifact that (1) has the highest degree of reproducibility as well as ease of use and documentation, (2) allows other researchers to easily build upon the artifact’s functionality for their own research, and (3) substantially supports the claims of the paper. We anticipate that at most one artifact (paper) would get the award, though the committee reserves the right not to award any artifact in a given year if none of them meet the criteria for the award.
    </p>

    <h2 id="jcl"><b>DSN 2025 Jean-Claude Laprie Award</b></h2>

    <p> The Jean-Claude Laprie Award in Dependable Computing is awarded annually by the IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance in his honor. The award recognizes outstanding papers that have significantly influenced the theory and/or practice of Dependable Computing. It takes the form of a memorial plaque presented to the author(s) at the Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN).
    </p>
    
      <p>
      Any paper relating to dependable and secure computing and published at least 10 years prior to the award year (i.e., 2015 or earlier for the 2025 award) is eligible.
      The award seeks to recognize papers that have had a significant impact in the intervening years in one or more of the three following categories:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Technical/scientific research impact</li>
      <li>Industrial/commercial product impact</li>
      <li>Broad impact on the dependable computing community</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    The award may be given to more than one paper.
    <p>
