      <h1><b>Code of Conduct for DSN 2025 and its Co-Located Events</b></h1>

      <p>In keeping with the IEEE Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment, DSN 2025 is committed to providing a welcoming space for all attendees.</p>

      <!--
      <p>A primary goal of DSN 2025 is to promote the open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression among researchers. These require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity.</p>
      -->
      <p>A core objective of DSN 2025 is to foster the open exchange of ideas and support freedom of thought and expression within the research community. Achieving this goal requires an environment that upholds the intrinsic value of every individual and group—one that promotes dignity, mutual respect, understanding, and a celebration of diversity.</p>

      <!-- 
      <p>For these reasons, DSN 2025 is dedicated to providing an inclusive harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in official communications channels, including social media. We want every participant to feel welcome, included, respected, and safe. There is no tolerance for unwelcome or hostile behavior or speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation at our conference and events.</p>
      -->
      <p>To that end, DSN 2025 is firmly committed to providing an inclusive, harassment-free experience for all participants—whether at our events or in official communication channels, including social media. We strive to ensure that every individual feels welcome, respected, included, and safe. DSN 2025 maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward any unwelcome or hostile behavior, including speech or actions that intimidate, cause discomfort, or hinder anyone's ability to participate fully in our conference and related activities.</p>
      

      <p>DSN 2025 conference is fully committed to contributing to promoting the goals stated in the <a href="#ieee_conduct">IEEE Event conduct and Safety Statement</a>.

      <h3><b>Expected Behaviour</b></h3>
      
        <!--
        We expect all DSN 2025 participants to behave professionally and to help create a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, volunteers, sponsors, organizers, speakers, venue staff, and exhibitors in all conference venues, including ancillary events and unofficial social gatherings:

        <ul>
          <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions;</li>
          <li>Be mindful of cultural differences in engagement – attendees come from all over the world and may have a different level of comfort with respect to language and personal space;</li>
          <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;</li>
          <li>Discuss and critique ideas, not people;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Unacceptable Behavior includes</b>: abusive or degrading language, sustained disruption of a talk or other activity, discrimination, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p><b>Harassment includes</b>: comments, writings, or actions including jokes that discriminate or denigrate an individual on the bases of race, color, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, disability, pregnancy, medical conditions, veteran status, or any other status protected by laws in which the conference is being held.</p>

        <p><b>Sexual Harassment includes</b>: unwelcome advances or propositions; inappropriate touching of an individual’s body; degrading or humiliating comments about an individual’s appearance; displaying or distributing sexually explicit images or messages.</p>

        Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this policy, even if they seem inconsequential.
        -->
        <p>We expect all DSN 2025 participants to conduct themselves professionally and contribute to a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for everyone involved — including attendees, volunteers, sponsors, organizers, speakers, venue staff, and exhibitors — across all conference spaces, ancillary events, and informal social gatherings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Speak and act with consideration and respect toward others;</li>
          <li>Be aware of cultural differences — participants come from diverse backgrounds and may vary in their comfort levels with language, gestures, and personal space;</li>
          <li>Avoid any demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing language and behavior;</li>
          <li>Engage in constructive discussion by focusing on ideas, not individuals;</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Unacceptable behavior includes</b>: abusive or degrading language, persistent disruptions of talks or activities, discrimination, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, use of sexual imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p><b>Harassment includes</b>: verbal, written, or physical actions — including jokes — that demean or discriminate based on race, color, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, disability, pregnancy, medical conditions, veteran status, or any other status protected by the laws of the country where the conference is held.</p>

        <p><b>Sexual harassment includes</b>: unwelcome advances or solicitations, inappropriate physical contact, derogatory or humiliating comments about someone’s appearance, and the display or distribution of sexually explicit images or messages.</p>

        <p>Please notify conference organizers or community leaders if you witness a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or any behavior that violates this policy — no matter how minor it may seem.</p>

      <h3><b>How to Report Unacceptable Behaviour</b></h3>

        Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should notify anyone on the venue staff or security, or report the incident to IEEE (<a href="mailto:eventconduct@ieee.org">eventconduct@ieee.org</a>). If you feel that you or someone around you is in immediate danger, please dial 112 on your phone (police, fire, ambulance).
        
        An individual violating these standards may be sanctioned or excluded from further participation at DSN 2025, without refund, at the discretion of the event organizers. Violations that are reported to IEEE will be investigated and may result in further sanctions (IEEE Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment).

      <h3 id="ieee_conduct"><b>IEEE Event Conduct and Safety Statement</b></h3>
      <p>IEEE believes that science, technology, and engineering are fundamental human activities, for which openness, international collaboration, and the free flow of talent and ideas are essential. Its meetings, conferences, and other events seek
          to enable engaging, thought provoking conversations that support IEEE’s core mission of advancing technology for humanity. Accordingly, IEEE is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment to all participants, including
