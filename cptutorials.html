          <h4>Overview</h4>
          Quantum computing is emerging as a disruptive force in cybersecurity, offering both new opportunities and substantial threats. While quantum systems hold the promise of solving computational problems far beyond the capabilities of classical computers, they also pose existential risks to modern cryptographic protocols. The ability of quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, to break widely used encryption schemes necessitates an urgent shift towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
          <br><br>
          This half-day tutorial will begin with an introductory lecture on the fundamentals of quantum computing, its implications for cybersecurity, and the challenges posed by quantum algorithms to classical cryptographic systems. This will be followed by an exploration of the current state of quantum software, including its pain points, development environments, programming frameworks, and providing an interactive demonstration of quantum programming. Finally, the tutorial will conclude with an in-depth discussion of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), its emerging standards, and strategies for transitioning security infrastructures to quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

          <h4>Overview</h4>
            The goal of this tutorial is to help attendees gain a clear understanding of when and how to use blockchain, what it can truly offer, and at what cost. Blockchain is often viewed as either a universal solution to all problems or an inefficient, energy-consuming technology with limited real-world applications. This tutorial aims to move beyond these extremes by offering a structured discussion on its actual strengths, trade-offs, and limitations.
            An essential part of this exploration is considering the role blockchain plays in solving specific problems. By examining Federated Learning (FL) as a use case, we will also explore whether, depending on the situation, blockchain is the best fit, or if alternatives can be used to achieve similar objectives with fewer trade-offs. This perspective will enable participants to understand how decentralization can enhance reliability and trust in FL, while also considering other approaches that may better address scalability, efficiency, and resource consumption.
          
          <h4>Outline</h4>
          The tutorial is structured as follows:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Federated Learning (FL), introduction and limitations.</b> Basic overview of the FL paradigm with a focus on its main limitations. (15 min)

          <h4>Overview</h4>
            Blockchains are often assumed to be fault tolerant due to their decentralized nature, yet real-world failures repeatedly challenge this assumption. Outages lasting days have been observed across major blockchain networks. Some could not even recover from transient isolated failures. Unlike traditional distributed systems, where well-established fault tolerance mechanisms exist, blockchains vary significantly in their consensus protocols, network structures, and failure handling approaches, making dependability evaluation particularly challenging. Despite the critical importance of fault tolerance, most blockchain benchmarking efforts focus primarily on performance metrics such as throughput and latency, often under ideal conditions that fail to account for real-world failure scenarios.
            <br><br>
            Evaluating fault tolerance requires a systematic approach to fault injection and measurement, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze blockchain resilience, recoverability, and failure impact. This tutorial focuses on dependability assessment, covering practical methods for introducing faults, observing their effects, and quantifying blockchain sensitivity to failures, providing a different perspectives on blockchain performance evaluation compared to our tutorial on performance benchmarking with DIABLO.
            <br><br>
            In this half-day tutorial, we will evaluate the fault tolerance of one of the six blockchains, Algorand, Avalanche, Aptos, Ethereum, Redbelly and Solana with the recent STABL benchmark suite. We will look at the sensitivity score and extend the observer node with another fault type.
          <h4>Outline</h4>
          The tutorial will have the following structure:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Introduction (20 min). What is blockchain, transaction throughput and latency, DIABLO and STABL benchmarking frameworks.
            <li><b>Simple Demo (30 min).</b> Using the virual machine image, members of the audience will run a local experiment on their own machines.
            <li><b>Fault Tolerance and Dependability (20 min).</b> Explanation of crash faults and network partitioning, and packet loss.
            <li><b>Fault Tolerance Demo (30 min).</b> We will introduce crash faults in the scenario and observe performance and sensitivity score under new conditions.
            <li><b>Benchmarking Details (20 min).</b> Explanation of metrics, workload types, and emulating various network conditions.
            <li><b>Advanced Demo (30 min).</b> We will explain the fault scenario implementation in STABL observer node and how to extend it with a new fault type.
            <li><b>Discussion (30 min).</b> Implications of design decisions, metrics and aspects to be evaluated.
