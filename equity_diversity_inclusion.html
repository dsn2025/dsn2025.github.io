      <h3><b>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in DSN 2025</b></h3>
    
      <p>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) are foundational principles that promote equal opportunities (equity), acknowledge and value personal, social, and cultural differences (diversity), and foster environments where everyone feels encouraged to participate, contribute, and belong (inclusion).</p>

      <p>DSN 2025 is committed to recruiting a diverse group of speakers and committee members, reflecting a wide range of social, cultural, and economic backgrounds and skill sets—including but not limited to gender, geographical location, career stage, research expertise, institutional affiliation, and representation from both academia and industry. We also encourage all reviewers to uphold high standards in recognizing quality research, while providing feedback that is clear, consistent, empathetic, and respectful.

      </p>

      <p>Everyone involved in DSN 2025 is expected to help create and maintain an environment where all participants feel welcomed, included, respected, and safe—regardless of their nationality, gender, sexual orientation, neurodiversity, race, socioeconomic background, or any other aspect of their individual identity.</p>

      <p>DSN 2025 is fully committed to contributing to promoting the goals stated in the <a href="#ieee_open">IEEE Computer Society Open Conference statement</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="ieee_open"><b>IEEE Computer Society Open Conference Statement</b></h3>
      <p>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its conferences. Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed. Diversity
          is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity.</p>
      <p>A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination. For this reason, the IEEE Computer Society is firmly committed
          to team compositions in all sponsored activities, including but not limited to, technical committees, steering committees, conference organizations, standards committees, and ad hoc committees that display Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.</p>
      <p>IEEE Computer Society meetings, conferences and workshops must provide a welcoming, open and safe environment, that embraces the value of every person, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age,
          marital status, religion, national origin, ancestry, or disability. All individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination, including harassment based on any of the above factors.</p>
