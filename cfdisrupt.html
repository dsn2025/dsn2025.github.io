    <h1><b>DSN-2025: Disrupt 25: Disruptive Ideas and New Interdisciplinary Results</b></h1>
    
    <p>Disrupt (Disruptive Ideas and New Interdisciplinary Results) is a recently introduced DSN track. The goal is to establish a forum to promote the discussion and early dissemination of highly innovative ideas and forward-looking research on dependability, including (but not limited to) interdisciplinary research that cross cuts dependability with application areas where safety, security, privacy, and computer systems resilience are primarily concerns. </p>

    <p>Disrupt 25 will publish three kinds of papers:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Disruptive ideas and thought-provoking reflections: </b>Forward-looking and disruptive ideas focusing on exciting new research problems or addressing classic persistent dependability challenges through a new angle, supported by well-argued scientific insights and concrete research plans going forward. 
    </li>

    <li><b>New Interdisciplinary Dependability Perspectives and Results: </b>Emerging research, ideas, or initial results exploring synergies with other disciplines and application sectors where dependability, safety, security, privacy, and resilience represent crucial research challenges for the success of new technologies and applications. 
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Emergent and Highly Innovative Results: </b>Bold and startling results from innovative techniques and tools, even if not complete, that can shed new light or induce new solutions for current research problems, or even question established results and call for new research directions. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h2><b>Submissions and evaluation</b></h2>
    <p>Disrupt 25 papers are submitted via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dsns2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dsns2025</a>. Submissions are limited to 4 pages + references in the IEEE Computer Society format and will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria:  

      <ul>
        <li>Value: relevance of the research problem and justification why it is worth exploring.
        </li>
    
        <li>Novelty: potential for disruption, to be highlighted with respect to the state-of-the-art.
        </li>
        
        <li>Feasibility: rationale and credibility of authors' contribution, conceivable impact and plans for further research to fully develop the work.
        </li>

        <li>Presentation: overall quality of the paper writing.
        </li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <p>Authors are strongly recommended to take into account the above evaluation criteria when preparing the submission.</p>

    <p>Accepted Disrupt 25 papers will be published in the supplementary volume of DSN proceedings. Given the emerging nature of the works published at Disrupt 25, and the size of the papers (4 pages + references), we anticipate that Disrupt 25 papers may lead to successful submissions of regular DSN papers in subsequent years. </p>

    <p>Disrupt 25 papers are not: 

      <ul>
        <li>A second-class DSN research track paper condensed into 4 pages. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Disguised advertisement of previously published works. 
        </li>
        
        <li>Announcement of recently funded projects. 
        </li>

        <li>A venue for conventional ideas and incremental results, or surveys of existing literature.
        </li>
        </ul>

    </p>




    <h2 id="disrupt_dates"><b>Important dates (<u>extended</u>) </b></h2>
    
    <p><span style="color: red">Feb 03, 2025</span> <del>Jan 27, 2025</del>: Abstract Submission Deadline</p>
    <p><span style="color: red">Feb 10, 2025</span> <del>Feb 03, 2025</del>: Paper Submission Deadline</p>
    <p>Mar 17 - 20, 2025: Author Rebuttal Period</p>
    <p>Apr 04, 2025: Notification to Authors</p>
    <p>Apr 28, 2025: Camera-ready Materials</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>: While abstract submission is highly recommended, papers submitted by the deadline without prior abstract submission will also be considered.</p>
    

    
  

    <h2><b>Anonymization rules and review process</b></h2>
    <p>The Disrupt 25 program committee will perform double-blind reviewing of all submissions. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review. </p>

    <p>Disrupt 25 submissions must use the same anonymization rules and recommendations as for papers submitted to DSN main research track. </p>

    <p>The rebuttal period happens after the papers have been reviewed, but prior to the Disrupt 25 program committee meeting. The reviews will be made available to the authors to provide a forum for responding to any factual errors in the reviews. Please note that this is NOT a forum to add any additional information on the paper, to submit an updated or revised paper, or to list changes the authors promise to include in the final version. Author responses will be made available to all PC members before the paper is discussed for selection in the Disrupt 25 PC meeting. Given their nature, comprehensive evaluation is not expected for Disrupt papers.</p>

    <p>All accepted papers must be presented by one of the authors at the DSN conference. </p>
    


    <p><b>Formatting Rules</b></p>
    <p>Disrupt 25 submissions must use the same formatting as for papers submitted to DSN main research track. </p>

    

    <h2><b>Open Science Policy</b></h2>
    <p>After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles, and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. </p>

    <h2><b>Ethical considerations</b></h2>
    <p>Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.</p>

    <p>Contact the program co-chairs if you have any questions.</p>

    <h2><b>Conflicts of Interest</b></h2>
    <p>Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs.</p>

    <p>Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper,
    including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion
    concerning the paper.</p>

    <h2><b>Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members:</b></h2>
    <p>To avoid potential bias, the Disrupt 25 Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General Chairs since double blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing and acceptance of papers.</p>
