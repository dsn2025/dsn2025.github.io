            <p>The William C. Carter Award is presented annually at the DSN Conference to recognize an individual who
                has made a significant contribution to the field of dependable computing through his or her graduate
                dissertation research. </p>
            <p>The IEEE TC on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance (TCFT) and IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable
                Computing and Fault Tolerance (WG 10.4) jointly sponsor the William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in
                Dependability. Instituted in 1997 as the William C. Carter Award, it was reformulated in 2016, where the
                present name and eligibility requirements aim at recognizing an individual who has made a significant
                contribution to the field of dependable and secure computing throughout his or her PhD dissertation.</p>
            <p>The award commemorates the late William C. Carter, a key figure in the formation and development of the
                field of dependable computing. Bill Carter always took the time to encourage, mentor, and inspire
                newcomers to this field and this award honors and sustains this aspect of his legacy.</p>
            <p>The award recipient receives a $750 US cash award as a contribution to travel expenses and a waived
                registration fee to attend the edition of the IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems
                and Networks (DSN) at which the award is presented. The recipient will be required to attend DSN to
                receive the award and is invited to give a short presentation to DSN attendees.</p>
            <p>To be eligible for the award, the nominee's PhD defense must be completed prior to the nomination
                deadline and must have occurred no more than 16 months prior to the nomination deadline. Previous
                recipients of the (old or renamed) Carter Award are not eligible.</p>

                    <b>Excerpt from the report of the selection committee:</b>
                    The PhD Dissertation ‚ÄúOffensive and defensive approaches for wireless communication protocols
                    security in IoT‚Äù focuses on the identification, assessment, and prevention of new threats linked to
                    the deployment of wireless communication protocols in the context of the Internet of Things. With
                    both a theoretical and experimental approach, the thesis investigates two orthogonal research lines
                    in IoT: i: offensive security, by identifying novel attack strategies; and ii: defensive security,
                    by defining and validating innovative intrusion detection and prevention strategies, as well as the
                    design of more secure communication protocols. The scientific contributions of this thesis are
                    highly innovative and of primary relevance in the area of resilient and secure computing. They have
                    been the subject of several scientific publications in top top-tier international peer-reviewed
                    venues, including three publications at IEEE/IFIP DSN. The practical impact of the achieved results
                    is highly significant, since the discovered attacks, which target major wireless protocols such as
                    BLE and ZigBee, affect billions of IoT devices around the world. The relevance at the industry level
                    is also noteworthy, as the tools developed within the thesis are increasingly adopted by security
                    organizations, such as ANSSI in France.
